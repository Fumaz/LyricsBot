# Lyrics Seeker ðŸŽµ
This bot was created as a way for users to find any song's info and lyrics.<br>
It works both in private chats and inline!


### How do I find a song?
Simply start the bot on Telegram (https://t.me/LyricsSeekerBot) and click on the "Search" button. Then, type a song, an artist or an album!<br>
You can also use the bot inline by typing "@LyricsSeekerBot (song)" in any chat!

### What does it show?
The bot is able to display...
- Release date
- Album
- Producers
- Writers
- Artists
- Media
- Album
- Poster

### Can I host it myself?
Yes! The bot is completely open source, and it's very simple to host it on your own.<br>
First, you will need to rename the `config.sample.py` file you can find in src/bot/ to `config.py`. Afterwards, edit the file with your bot's details.<br>
All you need to do now is install docker and docker-compose if you haven't yet, and then run `docker-compose up -d`!
